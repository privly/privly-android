## About ##

Privly is a developing set of browser extensions, mobile and web applications for usable internet content privacy. It allows users to view content on any website, without the host site being able to read the content. 
The Privly extensions support "Injectable Applications" (also known as Privly Applications), which are web applications viewed within the context of other web applications. These applications can be any web application, but they are generally oriented to supporting a privacy use case.

For more information on what Privly is, [read about us](https://priv.ly/pages/about).
 
The development home of Privly is at http://www.privly.org/. For information on how to join the Privly community, read this: http://www.privly.org/content/welcome-privly-development
